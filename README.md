# crispy-memory
First group project for UMN Coding Bootcamp

Our application is a drag and drop game. It is styled after Mr. Potato Head. It is built as a time waster for youngsters or people looking to get a laugh out of some simple random game. The idea was to make our mvp simple and add onto the orginal concept with some tougher coding. We employed firebase api in creating a login system that connects a google account to the Potato Face game page. From there the user can take snapshots of their potato and save them in an album in their google account. The snapshot gallery does not reset upon logout and login. We used Firebase API, interact js, google photos API, Firestore API and HTML to Canvas for our new technologies. The code for the login system is especially interesting and can be applied to many different kinds of applications.
